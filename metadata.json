  "description": "Bob Zane, a solitary desert wanderer who knows the Colorado Basin like few others, is approached one moonlit night by a nervous stranger seeking a tracker for a mysterious job. When a shooting erupts in a border town cantina and two men vanish into the desert with a team of horses—leaving only blood and whispers behind—Zane finds himself drawn into a puzzle he cannot solve. Set against the stark beauty of the Southwestern borderlands, this atmospheric tale weaves desert mysticism with hard-boiled suspense, where sand whispers secrets and survival depends on reading the land's cryptic signs.",

## About This Book

Bob Zane, a solitary desert wanderer who knows the Colorado Basin like
few others, is approached one moonlit night by a nervous stranger
seeking a tracker for a mysterious job. When a shooting erupts in a
border town cantina and two men vanish into the desert with a team of
horses—leaving only blood and whispers behind—Zane finds himself drawn
into a puzzle he cannot solve. Set against the stark beauty of the
Southwestern borderlands, this atmospheric tale weaves desert mysticism
with hard-boiled suspense, where sand whispers secrets and survival
depends on reading the land's cryptic signs.
